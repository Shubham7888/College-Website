                    <p> Placements are good. Especially the placements of computer science and information technology
                        are extremely good. Microsoft visit the campus for recruiting students for internship after
                        their second years. Microsoft offers a package of approximately 40 lacs per annum and similar is
                        the package offered by Amazon overall the placement is very good.

                    <p> Infrastructure of the College is pretty decent, industrial department is a bit old it need a
                        renovation and installation no f new machines and tools. Labs are good, classrooms are
                        pretty cool to be honest, library is bit of a disappointment for me but workable.
